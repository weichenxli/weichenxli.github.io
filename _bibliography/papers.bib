  summary={We use LLMs as inductive rule learner for code editing rules. We define three simple actions to identify inductive rules. We make model explicitly learn 1) functional specifications, 2) set of transformation rules, and 3) applicable rules for each code sample. The evaluation demonstrates our methodology can make the model generate code that is 23% faster, 12% more readable and 27% safer.},
